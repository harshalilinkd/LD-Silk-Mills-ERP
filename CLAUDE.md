# LD Silk Mills ERP Shell

Central entry point (login, sidebar, dashboard, module registry) for LD Silk
Mills' internal tools. Each module keeps its own database/schema; this repo
is the "building," not the "rooms" — except Orders, which was later ported
in as native pages (see Phase 3a below), not just linked to.

## Stack
Next.js 15 (App Router, TS strict) · Drizzle ORM + `postgres.js` · Auth.js v5
· Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui on Base UI (`@base-ui/react`) · Supabase Postgres
(no `@supabase/supabase-js` — plain Postgres connection, same as Order Entry).

## Database — one Supabase project, three schemas
Project **"LD Silk Mills"** (`ygxnbmfmrwookrilpbfx`), region `ap-south-1`.
No Neon involved anywhere (an earlier Neon project existed for one day in
Phase 1 and was deleted — do not recreate it).

| Schema | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ld_erp_core` | **This repo, exclusively** | `users`, `systems`, `system_access`, `audit_logs`. Nothing else reads/writes it. |
| `ld_order_entry` | **Shared** with the standalone Order Entry app | Same live tables, same rows — no sync, no copy. A row written by either app is instantly visible in the other. |
| `ld_help_slip` | Help Slip app only | Not touched by this repo at all. |

`src/db/index.ts` opens the one shared `postgres.js` connection (`sql`),
reused by `src/db/order-entry/index.ts` for the second schema — one pool,
two Drizzle instances. `drizzle.config.ts` has `schemaFilter: ["ld_erp_core"]`
— **this repo must never generate or apply a migration against
`ld_order_entry`**; that schema's migrations are owned by the Order Entry
repo. `src/db/order-entry/schema.ts` is query-only, hand-mirrored from
`github.com/mastersystem-linkd/LD-Order-Entry`'s `db/schema.ts`.

`DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` must be the Supavisor **Transaction pooler**
(port 6543), never the session pooler (5432) or direct connection.

## Auth — two layers, on purpose
1. **Shell session**: Auth.js v5, Google OAuth (credentials still TODO — see
   `.env.local`) plus a **temporary** shared-password `Credentials` provider
   (`DEV_LOGIN_PASSWORD` env var) for local testing before Google is wired
   up. Split `src/auth.config.ts` (Edge-safe, no DB import — used only by
   `src/middleware.ts`) vs `src/auth.ts` (full config, DB-touching
   callbacks) — `postgres.js` needs real Node APIs the Edge runtime doesn't
   have, so nothing DB-touching may ever be imported by middleware.
2. **Per-module authorization**: a user must already have a shell session to
   reach `/order-entry/*` or `/crm/*` at all. On top of that, each module's
   layout (`src/app/(app)/order-entry/layout.tsx`,
   `src/app/(app)/crm/layout.tsx`) calls
   `resolveOrderEntryAuthz(email)` (`src/lib/order-entry/authz.ts`), which
   looks the email up directly in `ld_order_entry.users` and resolves
   role/capabilities from `role_permissions` — **the same accounts and
   permissions Order Entry's own app uses**. Not found/inactive → a "not
   provisioned" screen, not a crash. There is no second login form for
   Orders/CRM; Order Entry's own bcrypt Credentials provider and login page
   were never ported.

**Remove the `DEV_LOGIN_PASSWORD` provider before Phase 2** (auth
hardening) — it's marked TEMPORARY in `src/auth.ts` and `.env.local`.

## Design system
`docs/DESIGN.md` is the single source of truth for every color/spacing/
typography value, sourced from the approved mockup
(`ld-silk-mills-erp-mockup.html`, not in this repo). When porting a
module's UI (like Orders), you restyle against this file — you do not
reuse the source app's own Tailwind classes, even though both apps happen
to use the same Base UI primitives.

**Two themes, dark default**: `src/app/globals.css` defines light tokens
on bare `:root` and dark overrides under `.dark` (added to `<html>` when
active). `src/components/shell/theme-toggle.tsx` flips it and persists to
`localStorage` (`ld-erp-theme`); a blocking inline script in
`src/app/layout.tsx` applies the saved choice before first paint. Never
hardcode a color — every raw `bg-white/N`/hex in a component is a color
that silently breaks in the other theme (this bit us once: `bg-white/5`
"neutral chip" idioms scattered across Orders/CRM pages were invisible
against a white light-mode background until replaced with the new
`bg-chip`/`bg-chip-strong` tokens). See `docs/DESIGN.md`'s Color tokens
section for the full light/dark table and the reasoning per token.

## Sidebar
Dynamic, driven entirely by `ld_erp_core.systems` + `system_access` — never
hardcoded. A system with `status != active` renders greyed/unclickable
regardless of any other setting. `src/lib/system-submenus.ts` is a small
hand-maintained map (not DB-driven) of which systems have a built sidebar
submenu; currently only `order-entry` does (Dashboard / New order / Orders
/ Order status / Operations / Settings, collapsible, auto-expands when
you're inside that section). Toggling a system's `status`/`route`/
`open_mode` in `/admin/system-registry` takes effect live, no redeploy.

## What's actually built vs. placeholder
- **Shell**: login, dynamic sidebar, topbar, dashboard, all 4 admin pages
  (`/admin/users`, `/admin/system-registry`, `/admin/access-control`,
  `/admin/audit-logs`) — real, functional.
- **Orders** (`/order-entry/*`, sidebar label "Orders" — system_code stays
  `order-entry`): Dashboard, Orders list/detail/create/edit, Order Status
  board — real, reads/writes live `ld_order_entry` data. Ported from Order
  Entry's own repo; see `src/lib/order-entry/*` and
  `src/app/api/order-entry/*`.
- **CRM** (`/crm/*`, own top-level sidebar entry, system_code `crm`):
  Follow-up queue (`/crm`), follow-up detail (`/crm/[id]` — a NEW dedicated
  route; the source app renders this as a draggable floating panel, this
  shell renders it as an ordinary page instead), Issues board
  (`/crm/issues`), Call log (`/crm/calls`), Customers (`/crm/customers`),
  CRM analytics (`/crm/analytics`) — real, reads/writes the same live
  `ld_order_entry` CRM tables (`crm_followups`,
  `crm_followup_attempts`, `crm_issues`, `crm_rating_criteria`,
  `crm_followup_ratings`, `crm_settings`) the standalone app uses. Ported
  from Order Entry's own repo; see `src/lib/order-entry/crm.ts` (pure
  vocabularies/derivations, dependency-free) + `crm-query.ts` (all reads,
  including the auto-reconcile that creates follow-up rows — there is no
  manual "create" anywhere) + `src/app/api/crm/*` +
  `src/components/order-entry/crm/*` (shared `Pill`/`StatusPill`/
  `SeverityPill`/`PriorityBar`, and CSS/SVG-only chart primitives — no
  `recharts` dependency; the source app's Recharts-based rating-trend chart
  was rebuilt as a small hand-rolled inline SVG, `RatingTrendLine`). The
  CRM admin config screen (rating-criteria CRUD, `crm_settings` editor) is
  NOT built — that's deferred to the Settings hub below; the API routes for
  it exist (`/api/crm/rating-criteria`, `/api/crm/settings`) but have no UI
  yet.
- **Operations tracking** (`/order-entry/tracking`): the index plus the
  per-order 7-stage board (`/tracking/[id]`), backed by
  `POST /api/order-entry/tracking/stage` and
  `GET /api/order-entry/orders/[id]/tracking`. Stage gating (order entry →
  stock checking → the five post-stock stages, which unlock only on
  `in_stock`) is enforced server-side by `applyStageProgress` in
  `src/lib/order-entry/workflow.ts` and mirrored in the board's UI. Untick
  and stock-downgrade never cascade-undo later work — both warn and leave
  it done.
- **Settings** (`/order-entry/settings/*`): Dropdown Master, Design
  Database, Time tracking, Users, Access, Trash — all real, ADMIN-only,
  backed by routes under `src/app/api/order-entry/` (lookups `[id]`/`bulk`,
  `design-database/*`, `stages/*`, `users/*`, `access`, `trash`,
  `orders/[id]/lines/[lineId]`). Note `design-database/` (admin CRUD) is a
  different endpoint from `designs/` (order-form autocomplete) — don't
  conflate them. User passwords use `bcryptjs` at cost 10, matching the
  Order Entry app they're shared with.
- **Not built yet**: the CRM settings tab (`/order-entry/settings/crm` —
  rating-criteria CRUD and the `crm_settings` editor). Its API routes
  exist; only the UI is deferred. Do not silently build it without
  checking scope.
- **Help Slip**: still a plain external link (opens its own app in a new
  tab) — no integration work done.

## Known gotchas (hit these once already — don't re-discover them)
- **Base UI `Menu.Item` fires `onClick`, not `onSelect`.** This is a Base
  UI app, not Radix — `onSelect` on a `DropdownMenuItem` is silently a
  no-op (TypeScript won't catch it either, since `...props` is untyped
  passthrough). The topbar/sidebar "Log out" button shipped broken this
  way for a while: it visually existed and the menu closed on click, but
  `signOutAction()` never ran, because it was wired to `onSelect`. Always
  use `onClick` for menu item actions, and manually click through any new
  menu item once in a real browser — this class of bug produces zero
  TypeScript errors and zero console errors.
- **Base UI `Menu.GroupLabel` (`DropdownMenuLabel`) must be inside a
  `Menu.Group` (`DropdownMenuGroup`)** or it throws
  `MenuGroupContext is missing` at render time — crashes the whole
  dropdown, not just the label. Wrap it: `<DropdownMenuGroup><DropdownMenuLabel>...`.
- **Base UI `Button` + `render={<Link/>}`** needs `nativeButton={false}` or
  it logs an accessibility warning every render.
- **Never pass an icon *component* as a prop from a Server Component to a
  Client Component** (e.g. `<NavLink icon={IconFoo} />` from a server
  file) — React Server Components can't serialize component references
  across that boundary. Pass a rendered element instead: `icon={<IconFoo />}`.
- **Multiple `next dev` instances on the same `.next` build** fight over
  the server-actions encryption key and throw a Web Crypto `OperationError`
  on any inline server action. Only ever run one dev server; if a stray one
  is still listening on an old port, kill it before starting a new one.
- **Stale `.next` cache after deleting a source file** throws
  `Cannot find module for page: ...` on the next build — `rm -rf .next`
  fixes it.
- **`ld_order_entry` and `ld_help_slip` both have RLS-related Supabase
  advisories** (RLS disabled on all 15 Order Entry tables; a few
  SECURITY DEFINER warnings on Help Slip) — pre-existing, not introduced by
  this repo, out of scope to fix here without an explicit decision.

## Commands
```
npm run dev / build / lint
npm run db:generate   # schema.ts -> new migration (ld_erp_core only)
npm run db:migrate    # apply pending migrations (ld_erp_core only)
npm run db:seed       # re-seed systems/users (idempotent upsert)
```

## Repo
`github.com/harshalilinkd/LD-Silk-Mills-ERP`, branch `main`. Order Entry's
own repo/deployment (`github.com/mastersystem-linkd/LD-Order-Entry`) and
Help Slip's are separate, untouched, and stay live permanently as fallback
— this repo never modifies them.
